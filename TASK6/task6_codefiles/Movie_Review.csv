"The box office success of Rani Mukerji's Mrs. Chatterjee Vs Norway is a testimony to the fact that viewey want to watch more of these inspiring stories on the big screen. Rani Mukerji is truly at her finest as Debika! #1WeekOfMrsChatterjee,positive
"I worked up a last-minute #JohnWick4 review. It’s amazing how my least favorite Wick sequel still outshines most contemporary American action movies (a testament to the franchise’s quality).",positive
"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. The alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant """"galaxy"""" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. A better title for the film would be """"It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances."""" The plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent.",negative
"It's been a year since the release of @ssrajamouli's Action Epic RRR, the movie is still making the headlines. Celebrating 1 year for Global Historic Sensation #RRRMovie",positive
"I loved Pathaan movie. One of best movies of SRK after his romance era. Action and plotting everything was breathtaking. ",positive
"I watch a lot of movies and I like to give them all a chance just in case there is something interesting or exciting to warrant a viewing Unfortunately this movie has none of these features it is pointless and offers nothing in the way of story line,acting or direction The plot is non-existent with the actors just going through the motions and the dialogue is sooo boring its embarrassing. I wish the previous reviewers had posted earlier as this would have saved me 95 mins of my time",negative
"Well. What did I just watch ? I'm not sure if I can find words to describe this train wreck.So, a ramdom dude takes a photo of a random woman in a park. All the mess starts there. The same woman knocks on the dude' door because...of convenient script. Minutes later, two people (killers) are coming to the dude's door too because of... convenient script. No action there. Woman and dude take a car and drive away. Still nothing happens.",negative
"I thought the cast was great. Brianna and Emma were exceptionaly talented in thier characters. Fun film.",positive
"I rarely stop watching a movie although how crappy it is. Well for this one I made an exception since its beyond boring. I cant leave long reviews so this is it.. SKIP IT",negative
"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But the thing is there is absolutely NOTHING to like about it lol. It's not funny, the acting is horrible, the plot is nonexistent and just nothing about this movie even makes sense. Don't waste your time with this one.",negative
"Respect for delivery persons after watching this movie. Nandita Das has done incredible job just by thinking of a movie like this. Rest of the work has been done with pure class by Kapil . I was a great fan of his comedy but had never imagined that he can also act so well. What an all rounder he is... I mean singing,standup, acting everything. Inhuman at his level. Direction is also great. The depiction of life of a common man from lower class is exact and incredible. Nothing in this movie is off. You are definitely going to get emotional after watching this movie. Also you will never disrespect any delivery boy ever.",positive
"I was thoroughly enjoyed buy the production design it's beautifully done. The costume design is meticulous, perfectly capturing the style and mood of the world. The hair and makeup are flawless, bringing an extra layer of authenticity to the characters and their world. If you're a fan of crime thrillers, this series is definitely worth a watch.",positive
"No grip in story. Pathetic acting by main actress. The guy with her more worse. If you have nothing too watch still do not watch it because it has no grip at all. Specially in one scene where they engage to help a damsel in distress looks so awful. Scenes shot are not good to be seen again. Main actor looks tired exhuasted in whole movie. Now she is taken someone along being such hot shot agent she is giving such stupid actions. So loose ends in movies that it makes me think why was it even made. So it is waste. I had to drag movie to see might at some point it be interesting but still it was draging and boring. Even dialogues seem too much annoying.",negative
"Ayushmann Khurrana is excellent as the leading man as he charms his way through the action and kick ass dialogues. Jaideep Alawat is fantastic as the antagonist, and their chemistry basically seals the deal for this movie.A Bollywood movie which has a good plot, better direction, acting with some kickass action and some banging music.",positive
"I'm not sure what accomplished director/producer/cinematographer Joshua Caldwell was thinking taking on this project. This film has got to be the epitome of terrible writing and should be a classroom example of 'what not to do' when writing a screenplay. Why would Joshua take on (clearly) amateur writer Adam Gaines script is beyond me. Even his good directing and excellent cinematography could not save this disaster.",negative
"Easily the best scream movie since the original. In every way (but one - explained soon) it's better than all the sequels. The opening scene is brilliant and the way they did it was scary and intense. The kills were brutal but felt realistic and that these things could actually happen.The things I loved most about this movie was the intensity and how scary it actually was. I love horror movies and I love scream more than anything but the sequels lacked intensity and being scary. This one up the intensity to 100, the chase scenes were perfect and could be the best of the series, except maybe for Gale in Scream 2.",positive
"Though the premise of 4 old friends setting out on Everest Base Camp at a very old age appears flimsy, the film portrays emotions and feelings most of us have. I have seen a few reviews as 'preachy' - but I sincerely feel it is what you and I would say if such situations arise. I really liked that the film is devoid of much of Bollywood formula. The only thing that can distance the film from majority is that it is set in a very affluent lifestyle. Could have been a more middle-class or 'upper middle-class' setting.
Boman Irani, Anupam Kher, Neena Gupta, Amitabh Bachchan, Sarika, Danny Denzongpa breeze through their roles. A normal Sherpa would have been apt with Parineeti as a trekker. Overall a good watch!",positive
"Brooklyn 45 ,A lot is done with a little, and the pacing is set up perfectly to make it feel like we are watching in real-time. Jeremy Holm and Kristina Klebe were amazing, and I felt so much for their characters on a personal level.",positive
"Going on to the negatives, the story does feel over-stretched and some of it comes over as vague and under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less unsettled and never gaining momentum. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them. Their annoying and illogical decision making and behaviours frustrates.Making the film feel bland and forgettable with not enough heart put into it. The effects are ropy at best, the sound quality is obvious and utilised cheaply (being too loud in the build ups and people's reactions) and excepting the quite good Katia Winter the acting isn't great, Sebastian Roche coming off worst, and the chemistry is bland.",negative
